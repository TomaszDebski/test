Explanation: Statements (1), (2), (3), and (4) are correct. (1) is correct because when a floating-point number (a double in this case) is cast to an int, it simply loses the digits after the decimal. (2) and (4) are correct because a long can be cast into a byte. If the long is over 127, it loses its most significant (leftmost) bits. (3) actually works, even though a cast is not necessary, because a long can store a byte.
